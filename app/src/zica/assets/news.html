Dear Students,
<BR/>
Greetings from ZICA!!!
<BR/>
I am sure you are tracking the spread of the <b>COVID-19</b> and realize that these past few days have seen an uptick in the number of cases being reported in India. Given the uncertainty and ambiguity of how the virus will behave or the speed/size of the outbreak in the country, we are putting in place steps that we believe will help minimize the risk of infection to you, your families and for all whom you care. Some of these steps might cause some immediate inconvenience but they are critical to ensuring that we prevent the spread of the virus and ensure safety for us individually and collectively across the community. Let us follow these to improve our continuous learning
<ul class="b">
<li>Let us maintain social distancing to reduce the spread of Coronavirus.</li>
<li>Regular classes at ZICA centre has been kept on hold as per the Government directive.</li>
<li>Attend online sessions regularly which are conducted by your ZICA Center</li>
<li>Practice the given assignments regularly</li>
<li>Learn from the video content or e-studio documents</li>
<li>If you have fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical care immediately</li>
<li>Stay informed and follow the advice given by your healthcare provider</li>
</ul>
Please be active and get connected with your respective ZICA centre during the lockdown. We will resume our centres once we receive new directives from the Government of India.
 
If you have any problems while learning from the ZICA APP, you can write to <a href="mailto:care@zica.org">care@zica.org</a>.


Take care and stay safe.
